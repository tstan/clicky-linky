# clicky-linky
short python script to click a bunch of links and download them to a folder

just paste all your links that you want to press one per line in the links.txt file

you can use ./clickylinky.py to run or probably do some executable magic if you feel like it

I used this script to download some files that were updated everyday to the same download links on a webpage.
